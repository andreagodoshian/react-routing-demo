# Getting this baby online...

...was almost as difficult as finding a man interested in having a literal baby with me. Sorry, "I have a problem with my throat chakra which manifests as poor speech." Don't worry: my new favorite crystal is Lapis Lazuli. 

Anyways. 

I can't tell you how many repos I made and deleted for this thing, because I kept doing it wrong. Omg that annoying "reinitialized existing git repository" error (even though I could have sworn I already ran $ rm -rf .git [therefore, I was going insane])!!

I know I still have a long ways to go before I'm can consider myself "good" at GIT... but I'm proud of myself. Because I feared that I would never get a project online from Git Bash.

P.S.

Guess who can pull her README.md updates from Git Bash?? Me!!
